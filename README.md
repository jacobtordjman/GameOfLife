# GmeOfLife
This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The game consists of a grid of cells that evolve through generations according to a set of simple rules. This project provides an interactive interface to visualize and control the simulation.

# Features
- Start/Stop: Control the simulation.
- Next: Move to the next generation.
- Clear: Clear the grid.
- Faster/Slower: Adjust the speed of the simulation.
- Generation Counter: Track the number of generations.
- 
# Files
- GOLMatrix.java: Manages the grid and the logic for cell evolution.
- GOLPanel.java: Handles the graphical representation of the grid.
- Main.java: Contains the main method and integrates the components.
- README.md: Documentation for the project.
